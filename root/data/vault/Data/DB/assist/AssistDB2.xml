Each piece of stonework is stippled and textured with thickly applied paint that mirrors the coarseness of natural stone, this texture in stark contrast to the smoothness with which the glowing aura of light from within the lamp is applied. Nearly starlight white at its centermost point, the flame of the lamp infuses the squared recesses of the niche with soft rays of light, the milky glass of the lamp’s shade appearing as though it is glowing in contrast to the darkness of the frame and the diffused lighting of the radiating aura. The painting is noticeably lacking a signature and the colors are softly blended and incredibly lifelike to give added weight to the simple study of the way the light plays within the stone niche, every highlight and shadow painstakingly teased into life by multiple layers of paint and minute, seamlessly blended brushstrokes. \\r\\n (\<[IronClaw:Props:Artist:Canvas]#111211\>)", "Assistee":"Chatters:AE:kj:kjell", "CharObj":\<Chatters:AE:el:elle\>, "Character":"Chatters:AE:el:elle", "Environment":"Allegory:Setting:Rinascita:Buildings:Southeast:PaintShop:Main", "Flag":"", "Links":(\{  \}), "Notes":"\<*\> Kjell (May  2 10:30): (discarded)\\n\\n", "Priority":10, "Queue":"custom", "Rev":1.2, "RevTime":"1619965830", "Server":"ironclaw", "Theatre":"IC", "TimeClaimed":"1619965830", "TimeClosed":"1619965830", "TimeFiled":"1619754653" ])

DRAWING ! drawing of a man in the moonlight. \\r\\nAngled to the left with his weight propped on one hand, this broad-shouldered figure is sketched with a heavy hand in charcoal, the contrast between dark and light stark in the diffused lighting of the nighttime scene. The background is shaded nearly black in entirety, against which the bright white of the drape of the shirt appears to almost glow by comparison. The fabric hugs the curvature of broad shoulders and muscular arms in intricately detailed folds accented by soft shading to lend even more realism to the anatomy of the form beneath. The most highly detailed part of the drawing is the face of the subject. A soft rim light hugs the smooth curve of the cheek and brow, accentuating the wide nose and full lips before it is lost to the facial hair that covers the pointed jaw in a lush beard. Most striking of all are the eyes, slivered catchlights of bright white against a grey backdrop, the solemn gaze turned fractionally away from the viewer in what appears to be deep thought. A hint of a smile crinkles the corner, the expression subtle as it just barely kisses the right-hand side of the lips. The relaxed tilt of the head displays the ornate pattern of folds and creases in the headscarf that coils around the hair, each inch of the fabric teased into dimensionality by a similarly soft play of shadow and light.

The taut musculature of his shoulders and back sweeps in a convex curve before it is obscured from view by a swath of dark blue fabric wrapped in folds around the waist. His hand is outstretched over the water, his fingers clasped tight in the grip of a nude female form standing in the waist-deep water of the lily pad laden pond. Corruscating auburn locks float atop the water around her hips, the coquettish expression of her face mirrored in the six other feminine forms that stand arranged behind her in the water. Each of these Naiads has similar fine features, but their hair is a rainbow of hues from jet black to pale blonde, the tresses clinging damply to the swell of their breasts to provide just a bare essence of modesty to the image. The background of the image is loosely detailed, the foliage dark and shadowed in contrast to the paleness of the skin of the subjects.

Her torso is bare, a simple swath of cloth wrapped around her hips and falling in flowing folds over her legs as well as those of her lover. Dionysus' expression is a mirror to his lover's; creased eyes honed in adoration upon the ecstatic expression of the woman seated upon his lap as he holds a wine glass aloft over her bare torso. The god of wine tilts the glass, a rivulet of the liquid within painstakingly carved into the immalleable stone in lifelike realism as it flows from the lip of the glass to land squarely on the hollow of the woman's chest before running down the smooth expanse of her stomach.
