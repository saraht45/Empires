Both Home Delights and the Rinascita Mercantile sell candles, but the colored ones are always random in shape and color. I would also love it if this could be implemented for other colored things, like the flowers and flower seed packets you can buy from the apothecaries. And also the cans of war paint from the Scottish merchant. Some of this stuff is fairly pricey for newer players, and it's frustrating and wasteful when people keep spending money and getting colors they don't want, and end up throwing stuff out. I know this is probably a low priority right now, what with the Outlands release so close.

So, long story short, I had 6 boxes to mail, and I was carrying the Consulate's food and dessert trays, which changed to 'boxes' in my inventory; it said I was carrying 8 boxes. I thought, 'He wouldn't really take them, would he?' Famous last words. For whatever gosh danged reason, this asshole npc took the dessert tray, but refused to take the food tray. And both trays were empty. Go figure. I tried 'revoke npc', but it said I wasn't offering him anything. I examined the post office, but the dessert tray is nowhere to be seen. Would you guys mind making me a replacement when you have the time? This is Consulate property. Also, while you're at it, Valentin's player never gave back the gold Scottish Ambassador ring before he quit the game. I would love to have one of those. Maybe that's the reason the guard at the gate just nods to me instead of bowing respectfully, like I've seen the gate guards do for other Ambassadors. Anyhoo, sorry about my stupid insistence at tempting fate, but at least I'm being a good play tester by finding all the ways to break the game! Thank you guys so much for all that you do!
