Reason given: Hiya. Was going to talk to you in person, but you're logged off. After deliberation about the alt-trading, we've decided that it's not reasonable to think you were going to send the items to me/Azrael, and for some reason sent them to your alt instead (let alone used the items with your alt.) As this is an issue that you've been suspended for before, and as it's likely that your story to the staff was... less than honest, and you've previously been suspended for lying to staff, I see no option other than a game ban. Of course, if you have any supporting evidence for your story (such as any earlier assists stating that you want to hand the items over to a staff member, etc.) then I will be very happy to reverse the ban. There is no end time for this ban, but after six months (so after 7/6/09) you are welcome to email me (azrael@ironclaw.skotos.net) or the staff in general (staff@ironclaw.skotos.net) and ask for the ban to be removed. For it to be removed, you will need to make a good argument why things are different, and why you won't repeat the same behavior. If you wish to discuss any of this, feel free to email me - azrael@ironclaw.skotos.net
