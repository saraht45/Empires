Yeah, I come and go, real-life permitting\\"", "21:57 [Lazarus:Coders\|Lazarus] \\"Just wondering if there was some oddity with the skotos servers, or something changed ftp-wise, I wasn't aware of.\\"", "21:57 [Coders\|Azrael] \\"Not to my knowledge, but it's possible that things got refreshed or rebooted or something, due to Shannon's upcoming changes?\\"", "21:58 [Lazarus:Coders\|Lazarus] \\"What are Shannon's upcoming changes?\\"", "21:59 [Coders\|Azrael] \\"You didn't get an email from him?\\"", "22:00 [Lazarus:Coders\|Lazarus] \\"Let me see. If I did, I missed it. Or it got swallowed up by spam.\\"", "22:00 [Coders\|Azrael] \\"There was an email that went out to game hosts - perhaps send him an email letting him know if you never got it.\\"", "22:00 [Lazarus:Coders\|Lazarus] \\"Not sure if I like the sound of that... not sure if changes mean a good thing, or bad.\\"", "22:01 [Lazarus:Coders\|Lazarus] \\"Around when was it sent?\\"", "22:04 [Lazarus:Coders\|Lazarus] \\"Well, nothing sent to either my skotos email, or my regular email.\\"", "22:08 [Coders\|Azrael] \\"Mail 'im. Tell him he forgot you :)\\"", "22:08 [Lazarus:Coders\|Lazarus] \\"Aww... I don't like being all forgotten.\\"", "22:09 [Lazarus:Coders\|Lazarus] \\"And examining the html element, it appears the image thingy is blank now, hence my missing button. I wonder if some theatre stuff got overwritten?\\"", "22:10 [Coders\|Azrael] \\"Or maybe just didn't load in the browser\\"", "22:10 [Lazarus:Coders\|Lazarus] \\"Doesn't load in three different browsers for me, so it's not a single browser issue.\\"", "17:06 [Lazarus:Coders\|Lazarus] \\"Anyone else laggy in skotos-land this past week?\\"", "17:06 [CM:Coders\|Geist] \\"Yea, we got hit earlier. Three hours ago?\\"", "17:07 [Lazarus:Coders\|Lazarus] \\"I've been noticing it for at least the past couple of days. Or I just have great luck and it's each time I log in. And it can't be due to the number of players slowing us down...\\"", "17:08 [CM:Coders\|Geist] \\"Shannon may be shifting some things around - I'm not sure.\\"", "17:08 [Lazarus:Coders\|Lazarus] \\"Yeah, figure that's it. I was just wondering if he was shifting just wherever Lazarus is... or all games.\\"", "17:09 [CM:Coders\|Geist] \\"I don't know how things are ultimately configured, so....\\"", "17:10 [Lazarus:Coders\|Lazarus] \\"I don't recall either. I think ages ago we shared a server with ICO... no clue how it's set up now.\\"", "22:36 [Lazarus:Coders\|Lazarus] \\"What are the port addresses again if someone wants to use a non-skotos client?\\"", "10:55 [LC:Coders\|Xios] \\"Good afternoon, all.  Had a question about NIP and selling.  should be an easy question but after half hour looking myself I'm stumped.\\"", "10:58 [Coders\|Khalim] \\"Holy shit, these channels work again?\\"", "10:59 [LC:Coders\|Xios] \\"Apparently.\\"", "10:59 [Coders\|Khalim] \\"I can try to help, though my experience with NIP is semi limited thus far.\\"", "10:59 [LC:Coders\|Xios] \\"At least between a couple games and honestly, Ironclaw is only other game I can think of that uses this code.\\"", "11:00 [Coders\|Khalim] \\"So what's the question?\\"", "11:00 [LC:Coders\|Xios] \\"I have a well established bartender here at our Irish bar.  He sells things fine.  I added a cheep green beer to the items he sells.  But when I ask him what he sells, he calls it a mug of apple brandy.\\"", "11:01 [Coders] \\"Khalim blinks.  Interesting.\\"", "11:01 [LC:Coders\|Xios] \\"I'm trying to figure out how to fix.  I assume the why is because the brandy was copied and details changed.\\"", "11:02 [LC:Coders\|Xios] \\"Correction:  trying to fix without having to go in and create a third set of items for green beer.\\"", "11:02 [Coders\|Khalim] \\"Gimme a sec.  Let me pull up one of our vendors to take a look at how the selling DB is formatted.  I'm guessing it's tied to the brief/superbrief of your drink.\\"", "11:03 [Coders\|Khalim] \\"k  So, yeah, you're using a trading list prop container, right?  Where each item is like ([ \\"object\\":\<Ironclaw:Props:Consumables:Food:Nuts:Peanut\>, \\"stock\\":-1 ])  or similar?\\"", "11:04 [LC:Coders\|Xios] \\"Eos:  As far as I can track in the object's inheritence, I should be overwriting all details.  It's parent isn't the apple brandy but UrAlchol which really confuses me as well.\\"", "19:30 [CM:Coders\|Kurzon] \\"Khalim you around?\\"", "14:07 [CM:Coders\|Kurzon] \\"Khalim, you get my email last week regarding the crier?\\"", "14:07 [CM:Coders\|Khalim] \\"Yup.  Haven't had a chance to work on it yet.  Start the new job on Monday, so my hours should return to sanity around then.\\"", "14:08 [CM:Coders\|Kurzon] \\"Cool, it's not a priority at the moment anyway, just an idea that struck me.\\"", "14:09 [CM:Coders\|Kurzon] \\"The more pressing concern is the Flame Festival stuff that's coming up, as well as functional armor code though we need to introduce MGen weapons first.\\"", "14:11 [CM:Coders\|Khalim] \\"Yeah.  MGen weapons would be nice, plus armor.  I'll have to figure out how to fix the fact that CM only -kinda- (and not really) uses NIP.  I seriously am not sure how we want to progress with that (whether that is to spend the time to update couriers/bartenders/etc to NIP, or just do the salamander as CM NPC).\\"", "14:12 [CM:Coders\|Kurzon] \\"To be honest I've never touched nip.\\"", "14:12 [CM:Coders\|Kurzon] \\"so I don't have a whole lot of input there, it's whatever you think's easier\\"", "14:13 [CM:Coders\|Kurzon] \\"But what I'm looking for is a sort modular script. The idea is that we can parent various merchant NPCs under a UrMerchant parent, and then just plug in variables such as items and price costs and what type of currency they accept.\\"", "14:13 [CM:Coders\|Khalim] \\"Since it's pretty unused in CM, I'm not surprised.  The easier is to either just custom code the salamander to meet our needs or use the CM NPC system, since the verbs are all tied to it already for inventory (which means transitioning to NIP trading is a heck of a task involving 1. updating all the NPCs, 2. updating the verbs, 3. testing EVERYTHING, and 4. hoping we don't miss anything).\\"", "14:16 [CM:Coders\|Kurzon] \\"So like for this event, the merchant will be Salamander the fire elemental. He'll accept some kind of \\"fire token\\" currency, we'll say magical chunks of coal. He'll have items like flameweave, smokeweave, firestones, etc, for sale. You'll require X \\"favor\\" with him before he'll sell you certain items, depending on that item's quality (favour will be gained by doing little quests that will be available throughout the duration of the event)\\"", "14:00 [Lazarus:Coders\|Wende] \\"Question on Tree of Woe, how did you solve the issue of the Java plugin not working, and is there an alternet access to the tree? Thanks.\\"", "01:31 [Lazarus:Coders\|Lazarus] \\"Too many objects over in Ironclaw-land?\\"" \})
